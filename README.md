This project is a customer churn prediction model built using Python and machine learning, which predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a service based on their details and usage patterns. It includes data analysis, feature engineering, model training with scikit-learn, and an interactive web app (using Streamlit) to input customer information and instantly view churn predictions.

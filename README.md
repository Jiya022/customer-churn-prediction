This project is a customer churn prediction model built using Python and machine learning, which predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a service based on their details and usage patterns. It includes data analysis, feature engineering, model training with scikit-learn, and an interactive web app (using Streamlit) to input customer information and instantly view churn predictions.

### 📊 Dataset
The model was trained on the [Telecom Customer Churn Insights](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/telecom-customer-churn-insights-for-analysis) dataset from Kaggle. It contains 1,000 customer records featuring 8 behavioral and demographic attributes (such as tenure, monthly charges, and internet service type).
